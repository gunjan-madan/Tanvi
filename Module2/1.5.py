# Do you know what the Pythagoras Theorem is? 
# The Pythagoras theorem states that “In a right-angled triangle,  the square of the hypotenuse side is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides“. 
# The sides of this triangle have been named as Perpendicular, Base and Hypotenuse.
# The hypotenuse is the longest side, as it is opposite to the angle 90°.

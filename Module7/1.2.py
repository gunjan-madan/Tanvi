# The brownie points are calculated at the end of the week and each one gets a goodie package, based on their score.
# 5 brownie points for exercising 1 to 3 hrs
# 10 brownie points for exercising 4 to 6 hrs
# Anything more than 6hrs, you get 15 brownie points.
# Can you help Mr.Beaver write a Python program that calculates the brownie points earned by each member in a week.
# Mr.Beaver wants a list that displays the name of the family member, hours worked and brownie points earned.
# For example [Otto, 3,5,Beth,5,10, Bob, 2,5,Emma,7,15]

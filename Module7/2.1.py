#Dictionaries
# A dictionary is defined by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}). 
# A colon (:) separates each key from its associated value
# In the code that you just executed, the key value pair represented is of an author and their book.

# To know more, uncomment the statements below and click Run.

# To access an item in the dictionary you need to specify the key.
# For example, to access the book written by Roald Dahl, you need to type:

print(books["Roald Dahl"])
print(books.get("Roald Dahl"))

#To view all the values or keys in a dictionary 
print(books.values()) 
#will print all the values of the dictionary librarians

#Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key. Duplicate keys will overwrite existing values.

# Some of the members of the library are moving to a new town.
# So they have approached Mr.Bumblebee to unsubscribe their membership.
# To remove a key-value pair from the you need to use the pop()  method.
# The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name.

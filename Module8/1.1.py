# In Python, anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword.
# We use lambda functions when we require a nameless function for a short period of time.
# lambda functions are defined using the keyword lambda followed by the arguments and expression.

'''Task 1: What's in a name?'''
print("***** Task 1: ******")
print()
# Uncomment the statement below and click Run
#num = lambda b: b + 10
#print(num(5))


# In the program you just executed b is the argument and b+10 is the expression that gets evaluated and returned.

'Task'
# Write a program that 
# - Takes a number as input from the user.
# - The number is passed as an argument to an anonymous function.
# - The anonymous function returns the square and cube of the number


'''Task 2: More arguments'''
print("***** Task 2: ******")
print()
#Uncomment the statement below and click Run
#num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
#num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
#tot=lambda x,y:x+y
#print("The sum of the numbers is: ",tot(num1,num2))

# What did you observe? 
# A lambda function can accept more than one argument separated by commas.
# In the above code,  x and y are passed as arguments.

'Task'
# Modify the above program to find the product, quotient and difference between the two numbers.

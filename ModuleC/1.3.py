# In one of the previous goals, you used the class design to create a banking application.
# Lets modify the program to use the exception class to handle errors.

# The banking application program using the class design has been provided.
# Use the exception class to handle the errors a user might encounter. Here are some of the scenarios where you might encounter errors:
# - Withdrawal amount is greater than balance
# - Selecting options not shown in the menu
# - Entering non-numeric data(check for ValueError)
  

# Creating a class called student

 # initialize variables

 # Method to withdraw money
